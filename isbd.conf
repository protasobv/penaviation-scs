# This is the mavlink-splitter configuration file.

# Syntax
#
# The configuration file is composed of sections, each containing a set of
# key-value-pairs. Section names, keys and pre-defined values are case
# insensitive. Sections can have names when they have multiple instances.
#
# Lines starting with a `#` symbol are considered a comment and ignored.
# Comments at the end of a line are not allowed.
#
# A section starts with `[$section_type name-of-section]`. The name must not
# contain any blanks.
# Keys-value-pairs are separated by a `=` sign, the surrounding whitespace is
# ignored. So `key=value` is the same as `key = value`.
#
# Boolean values can either be defined as <true>/ <false> or <1>/ <0>.
# Lists are comma separated.
#

## General Configuration
##

[General]
# this section only has one instance and therefore no name
# Print traffic statistics to stdout
# Default: <false>
ReportStats = false

# Logging verbosity (stderr)
# Valid values: <error>, <warning>, <info> or <debug>
# Default: <info>
DebugLogLevel = info

# Default: 0 (de-duplication disabled)
#DeDuplicationPeriod = 0

## TCP Server Endpoints
# Listen for TCP connections on this port. Set to 0 to disable.
# Default: 5770
TcpServerPort = 5770

## Flight Stack Logging

# Define the MAVLink dialect used by the flight stack, so mavlink-router can
# log appropiately. In <auto> mode, the flight stack will be deferred from the
# heartbeat message.
# Valid values: <auto>, <common> or <ardupilotmega>
# Default: <auto>
MavlinkDialect = auto

# Enable flight stack logging and specify directory to save log files in.
# No default/ disabled by default.
Log = /home/pi

# Define when to store flight stack logs. From the start of mavlink-splitter
# until it's stopped or just while the vehicle is armed.
# Valid values: <always>, <while-armed>
# Default: <always>
LogMode = always

# Preset the FCU MAVLink ID from which logs should be received. If absent, it
# will be set to the system ID of the first flight stack heartbeat received.
# No default value.
LogSystemId = 1 

# Auto-delete old log files until there's at least the configured amount of
# bytes free on the storage device. Set to 0 to disable this functionality.
# Default: 0 (disabled)
MinFreeSpace = 1000000000

# Auto-delete old log files to not have more files than configured. Set to 0 to
# disable this functionality.
# Default: 0 (disabled)
MaxLogFiles = 0

# SnifferSysid
# Forward all traffic to endpoints on which this MAVLink system ID is connected.
# This can be used to log or view all messages flowing though mavlink-router.
# Default: 0 (disabled)
#SnifferSysid=254
